    - Exercise 1:

    Define a new function fungus_among_us() which accepts a list plants as an argument
    - return True if the function contains the string "fungus" and False if not
    - don't overthink this one, there's a very simple method to doing it...
    
    Example: fungus_among_us( ["tree", "flower", "fungus", "moss"] ) >>> True
    
    - Exercise 2:

    Define a new function total_bill() which accepts a list of numbers item_costs
    - return the sum total of all items in the list
    
    Example: total_bill( [6, 9.99, 20] ) >>> 35.99
    
    - Exercise 3:

    Define a new function halfway_there() which accepts a list of arbitrary data items longer than 1 item
    - insert the string "HALFWAY" at the middle of the list and return the altered list
    - when inserting, you will need to make sure your index is an integer...
    
    Example: halfway_there( [1,2,3,4,5,6] ) >>> [1,2,3,"HALFWAY",4,5,6]

"""
    In a new file create a class Human and import it into your current working file...

    - A Human needs these required attributes defined by its __init__ method: first_name:str, last_name:str, age:int, address:str, and is_hungry:bool
    - A Human has a __repr__ method that outputs their information like this: Human( first_name=Bob last_name=Marley age=30 address=Jamaica is_hungry=False )
    don't forget self in your parameters!
    - A Human has a method named full_name() which returns a string that's a combination of their first_name and last_name
    - A Human has a method named order_drinks() which returns "Party time!" if their age is 21 or higher and "Denied" if their age is less than that
    - A Human has a method named eat() which sets their is_hungry attribute to False
    - A Human has a method named win_lottery() which sets their address attribute to Disneyworld

    BONUS: utilize **kargs in order to take in and assign any attribute while creating a new Human
